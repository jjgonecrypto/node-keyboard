[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-keyboard.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-keyboard)

A REPL where music is simply streams of input in node. Uses the awesome soundfonts of [midi-js-soundfonts](https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts). Supports optional MIDI input.

##Install via
    npm install -g node-keyboard

> **Note: Installing node-keyboard will clone a soundfont library during install, resulting in an 800MB download.**

##Run via
    node-keyboard

##Examples
Inside the REPL, the examples in the example folder are loaded as getters with the prefix `example_`. E.g. `example_01_scales.chromatic({ key: 'b', ms: 100 })`

##Streaming Functionality tl;dr

* [MIDI In](#midi-in) support by `midiIn`, pipe to audio via `.pipe(toAudio)`
* [Create a stream](#create-a-stream) of notes using `from`
* [Delay playing](#delay) across a cycle of intervals via `.pipe(delay(...))`
* [Select instrument](#with-instrument) or play with a random one via `.pipe(on(...))`

###MIDI In
Pipe the `midiIn` stream to a number of writable outputs. (*To function, your MIDI device must be on when node starts.*)

`toAudio` will play the notes

```javascript
midiIn.pipe(toAudio)
```

`toRepl` will output the notes in the REPL

```javascript
midiIn.pipe(toRepl)
```

`toPiano` will draw the piano for each note played

```javascript
midiIn.pipe(toPiano)
```

`toLogger` will console log the note (pipe after `toAudio` to see more information about the played note)

```javascript
midiIn.pipe(toLogger)
```

Or pipe them through each other
`midiIn.pipe(toPiano).pipe(toAudio)`

And remove from MIDI input via `midiIn.unpipe()` (or `CTRL`+`C`)

###Create a Stream
Create an [infinite] stream of notes from an array using `from` (supports notes as variables).

```javascript
from(c, e, g).pipe(toAudio) // Hit CTRL+C (SIGINT) to unpipe immediately
```

> Note: supports all notes A0 to Cs8/Db8 (Cs8 is the syntax-friendly version of 'C#8')

###Delay
Use `delay(...args)` to return a transform stream that will emit after the given delays (where the delays are cycled)

```javascript
from(c1, g1, c2, g2, c3, g3).pipe(delay(250, 250, 500)).pipe(toAudio)
```

###With Instrument
Use `on(instrument)` to return a transform stream that will ensure the given instrument is used.

```javascript
from(c,e,g).pipe(on('guitar')).pipe(delay(200)).pipe(toAudio)
```

> Note: Breaking via CTRL+C will stop the stream by unpiping **everything**

##Functionality (sans streams)
Functionality, without the streams.

###Properties
* `instruments` list all instruments available
* `scales` list all scales supported

###Side effects
* `play(note)` plays a note.
Eg.
```javascript
[c,e,g].forEach(play)
```

* `piano(note)` draws the piano playing that note
Eg.
```javascript
[c,e,g].forEach((note, i) => setTimeout(() => piano(note), 400 * i))
```

* `log(note)` logs the note to `stdout`. (Includes the instrument if chained after `play`)
Eg.
```javascript
[f,a,c].map(play).forEach(log)
```

###Projections
* `chord(name)` projects a chord name out to an array of notes. 
Eg.
```javascript
chord('cm9')
// [ 'c4', 'eb4', 'g4', 'bb4', 'd5' ]
```

* `scale(note, name)` projects a note through the named scale
Eg.
```javascript
scale('a', 'flamenco')
// [ 'a5', 'bb5', 'c#6', 'd6', 'e6', 'f6', 'g#6' ]
```

* `sequence(note, ...semitones)` projects a note through the given semitone sequence
Eg.
```javascript
sequence(c, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2) // c minor scale
// [ 'c3', 'd3', 'eb3', 'f3', 'g3', 'g#3', 'a#3', 'c4' ]
```

###Functors
* `instrument([name]])` returns mapping function to play on instrument. If no parameter provided it chooses a random instrument.
Eg.: 
```javascript
[c,e,g].map(instrument('guitar')).forEach(play)
```

* `interval(...intervals)` returns mapping function to project intervals.
Eg. 
```javascript
[c,e,g].map(interval('P1','P5')).reduce((acc, cur) => acc.concat(cur), [])
// [ 'c3', 'g3', 'e3', 'b3', 'g3', 'd4' ]
```

* `only(...numbers)` returns filter predicate to filter out to required interval positions.
Eg.
```javascript
scale(c, 'major').filter(only(1,3,5,7)).map(play) // Cmaj7
```

##Plugins

* RxJS support and examples via [node-keyboard-rx](https://github.com/justinjmoses/node-keyboard-rx)
* Mouse support (OSX only) at [node-keyboard-mouse](https://github.com/justinjmoses/node-keyboard-mouse)
* Twitter support at [node-keyboard-twitter](https://github.com/justinjmoses/node-keyboard-twitter)
* MongoDB support at [node-keyboard-mongo](https://github.com/justinjmoses/node-keyboard-mongo)

##Known Issues
* Reusing a stream and repiping it through transformers
E.g. 
```javascript
let guitar = from(c,e,g).pipe(on('guitar')).pipe(delay(200))
guitar.pipe(toAudio) 
// CTRL+C
guitar.pipe(toAudio) // works
// CTRL+C
guitar.pipe(on()).pipe(toAudio) // works first time only
// CTRL+C
guitar.pipe(on()).pipe(toAudio) // won't play the guitar stream's final on() is still piped to the previous on()
```

###FAQ

1. When no octave is provided (e.g. `play(a)`) then 3rd octave (`a3` 220Hz) (starting at `c3` on an 8-octave piano) is the default.

2. `a0`, `bb0` (`a#0`) and `b0` are the only notes below `c1`

3. Sharp can be denoated by `s` when not surrounding note by strings (i.e. `as4 ==== 'a#4')`. Double-sharp is denoted with `x` as in `ax3` (enharmonically `b3`). Double-flat is denoted with `bb` as in `bbb3` (enharmonically `a3`)
